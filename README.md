Invoice System

The problem. Our customer provided us with the following statement of their needs.

Start: The subject is to invoice orders. To invoice is to change the state of an order (to change it from the state “pending” to “invoiced”). On an order, we have one and one only reference to an ordered product of a certain quantity. The quantity can be different to other orders. The same reference can be ordered on several different orders. The state of the order will be changed into “invoiced” if the ordered quantity is either less or equal to the quantity which is in stock according to the reference of the ordered product. You have to take into account new orders, cancellations of orders, and entries of quantities in the stock. End.

Below, are the submission instructions for the various phases of the project, and details of the project and what you must do.

You will learn to elicit requirements from a customer and write precise requirements documents that satisfy their needs.
